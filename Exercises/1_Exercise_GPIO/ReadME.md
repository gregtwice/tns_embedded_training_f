# Exercise on GPIO

This first exercise introduces the usage of GPIOs.
You will control some LEDs to turn them ON or OFF.
In this exercise you will be using the STM32 HAL library "insert link" which provides basic APIs to facilitate the utilization of your STM32 board.
You will be able to learn how to execute this task without those in future exercises.

## Question 1 : Turn on the User LED

The goal of this question is to create a code that will turn on the User LED.
Create a function in the main file that will turn on the UserLED.
Then call this funtion in the main function, in the infinite loop.

## Question 2 : Blink the User LED

Create a function in the main file that will Toggle the UserLED.
Then call this funtion every seconde in the main function, in the infinite loop.

## Question 3 : Use button to turn on the lED

Button to turn on the LED

## Question 4 : Use button with interruption mode

Button to turn on LED with interruption

## Question 5 : Turn on LED with PWM

## Question 6 : LED Dimmer
